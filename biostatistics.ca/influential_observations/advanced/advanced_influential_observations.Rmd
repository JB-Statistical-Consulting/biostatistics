# Advanced Influence Measures for the Stats Nerds

```{r, echo = FALSE, include = FALSE}

library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)

So far, we used DFBETAS and DFFITS, which are intuitive influence measures : the change in model paramters and the (studentized) change in model predictions, respectively. There are more sophisticated measures that are also returned from a call to `influence.measures`, namely the covariance Ratio, Cook's D and the diagonal element of the Hat matrix (aka leverage).
